For this project Sam completed the tilemap, music, scenes, and scene transition. Jory completed character movement. Both completed character doublejump. 
Joys came when the tilemap was completed, the scenes transitioned, and the jump worked. Struggle came with the double jump with the jump count integer
being inconsistant and the character becomeing stuck in the ground.
